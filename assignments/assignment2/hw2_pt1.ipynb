    "A hunter has two hunting dogs. One day, on the trail of some animal, the hunter comes to a place where the road diverges into two paths. He knows that each dog, independent of the other, will choose the **wrong** path with probability $p$. The hunter decides to let each dog choose a path, and if they agree, take that one, and if they disagree, to randomly pick a path. Is his strategy better than just letting one of the two dogs decide on a path?\n",
